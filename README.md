# 3D-Scanner

A 3D scanner using Nema 17 AC motors, Arduino, Sharp IR sensor, and an SD card memory reader is a device that captures the three-dimensional geometry of objects and stores the scanned data on an SD card. This scanner utilizes precise Nema 17 AC motors, an Arduino microcontroller, a Sharp IR sensor, and an SD card memory reader to facilitate the scanning process and data storage.

The hardware components of the 3D scanner include Nema 17 AC motors, which are stepper motors known for their precise control and positioning capabilities. These motors are responsible for moving the scanning mechanism or the object being scanned, allowing for controlled rotations or translations.

The Arduino microcontroller serves as the control unit of the 3D scanner. It receives input from the Sharp IR sensor, processes the data, and generates output signals to control the motors and other peripheral devices. Arduino provides a flexible and customizable platform for implementing the scanning algorithm, managing the scanning process, and interacting with the memory reader.

The Sharp IR sensor is utilized to measure the distance between the scanner and the object being scanned. It emits infrared light and measures the time it takes for the light to bounce back, enabling the calculation of the distance. This data is used to create a depth map or point cloud representation of the object's surface.

The SD card memory reader is employed to store the scanned data. It allows for the convenient and portable storage of the collected depth maps or point clouds. The Arduino communicates with the SD card memory reader to write and read data from the SD card.

The scanning process of the 3D scanner typically involves the following steps:

Object Placement: The object to be scanned is positioned within the scanning area, ensuring that it is visible from all angles and can be reached by the scanning mechanism.

Distance Sensing: The Sharp IR sensor measures the distances between the scanner and the object from multiple viewpoints. This data is used to create a depth map or point cloud representing the object's surface.

Motor Control: The Arduino microcontroller receives the sensor data, processes it, and calculates the precise movements required to capture the complete geometry of the object. It sends control signals to the Nema 17 AC motors, which rotate or translate the scanning mechanism or object accordingly.

Data Storage: As the scanning process progresses, the Arduino stores the collected depth maps or point clouds onto the SD card memory reader. This allows for efficient and portable storage of the scanned data.

Post-processing and Analysis: The stored data can be further processed using various algorithms and techniques to remove noise, fill gaps, and enhance the quality and accuracy of the scanned model. Additional analysis and visualization can be performed on the data to extract meaningful information or create visually appealing representations.

The 3D scanner using Nema 17 AC motors, Arduino, Sharp IR sensor, and SD card memory reader offers a comprehensive solution for capturing and storing 3D geometry. It finds applications in fields such as 3D modeling, reverse engineering, prototyping, quality control, and computer graphics. With precise motor control, accurate distance sensing, and portable data storage, this scanner enables the creation of detailed and accurate digital representations of real-world objects.
